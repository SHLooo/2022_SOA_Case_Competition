Load data

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

file_path <- "/Users/liushuhao/Desktop/SOA Case Competitoin/data/2022-student-research-case-study-player-data_modified.xlsx"

#read in tables
LeagueGoalkeeping <- read_excel(file_path, sheet = "League Goalkeeping", skip = 11,col_names =T, na = "N/A")
TournGoalkeeping <- read_excel(file_path, sheet = "Tournament Goalkeeping", skip = 11,col_names =T)
```

Add rank to data

```{r}
TournResult2020 <- read_excel(file_path, sheet = "Tournament Results", range = "B11:C27", col_names =T, na = "N/A")
TournResult2021 <- read_excel(file_path, sheet = "Tournament Results", range = "E11:F35", col_names =T, na = "N/A")

TournGoalkeeping$"nation rank" = rep(NA, nrow(TournGoalkeeping))
for(i in seq(1:nrow(TournResult2020))) {
  nation <- TournResult2020$Country[i]
  TournGoalkeeping$"nation rank"[which(TournGoalkeeping$Nation == nation & TournGoalkeeping$Year == 2020)] <- TournResult2020$"2020 Tournament Place"[i]
}
for(i in seq(1:nrow(TournResult2021))) {
  nation <- TournResult2021$Country[i]
  TournGoalkeeping$"nation rank"[which(TournGoalkeeping$Nation == nation & TournGoalkeeping$Year == 2021)] <- TournResult2021$"2021 Tournament Place"[i]
}
```


Selecting variants:

attributes: Playing Time 90s, Performance GA90, Performance Save%, Penalty Kicks Save%

```{r}
goalkeeping.attributes <- c("Player", "Playing Time 90s", "Performance GA90", "Performance Save%", "Penalty Kicks Save%")
LeagueGoalkeeping.data <- LeagueGoalkeeping[, goalkeeping.attributes]
TournGoalkeeping.data <- TournGoalkeeping[!is.na(TournGoalkeeping$`nation rank`), c(goalkeeping.attributes, "Year", "nation rank")]
```

Fill in missing data

```{r}
for(attribute in goalkeeping.attributes){
  if(sum(is.na(LeagueGoalkeeping.data[,attribute]))) {
    # find out the columns with missing values
    print(paste(sum(is.na(LeagueGoalkeeping.data[,attribute])), "missing values in League Goalkeeping: ", attribute))
    # fill the missing values with 0
    LeagueGoalkeeping.data[is.na(LeagueGoalkeeping.data[, attribute]), attribute] <- 0
  }
}
for(attribute in goalkeeping.attributes){
  if(sum(is.na(TournGoalkeeping.data[,attribute]))) {
    # find out the columns with missing values
    print(paste(sum(is.na(TournGoalkeeping.data[,attribute])), "missing values in Tournament Goalkeeping: ", attribute))
    # fill the missing values with 0
    TournGoalkeeping.data[is.na(TournGoalkeeping.data[, attribute]), attribute] <- 0
  }
}
```

Group rows by player

```{r}
# Use the average value for each attribute
LeagueGoalkeeping.groupByPlayer <- LeagueGoalkeeping.data %>%
                                 group_by(Player) %>%
                                 summarise_all(mean)

#TournGoalkeeping.groupByPlayer <- TournGoalkeeping.data %>%
#                                 group_by(Player) %>%
#                                 summarise_all(mean)
```

fit model

```{r}
set.seed(123456)
#Generate a random number that is 90% of the total number of rows in dataset.
ran <- sample(1:nrow(TournGoalkeeping.data), 0.9 * nrow(TournGoalkeeping.data))
